        <h3>BUILDING INFORMATION AND MODELLING</h3>
        <h4>
            <p>
                BIM is a modeling technology and associated set of processes to produce,communicate,and analyze building
                models.It is used for designing and increasing the efficiency of the project by improving collaboration between
                different stakeholders throughout the project life cycle and producing a central model. It is done by modeling
                building elements, implementing interiors and circulation,views and visualization using Autodesk Revit.

        <h3>SUMMER MENTORSHIP PROGRAM ON OPTIMIZATION OF TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM USING DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS</h3>
        <h4>
            <p>
               A traffic control system can be achieved by optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion using various DSA
               techniques. The objective is to develop a software solution that can optimize the flow of traffic and use DSA to
               model and analyze traffic patterns and make real-time adjustments to traffic signals and routes based on
               current conditions.
